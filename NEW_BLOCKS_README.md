# New Blocks and Textures Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds 4 new block types to the Minecraft clone and expands the texture atlas to accommodate them.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Block Types Added
- **COBBLESTONE**: A stone-like building material with a rough, weathered appearance
- **BRICK**: A red building material with mortar lines, suitable for structures
- **PLANKS**: Wooden planks with vertical grain, processed wood material
- **IRON_ORE**: A mineral block with iron deposits, found underground

### 2. Texture Atlas Expansion
- **Before**: 4x4 atlas (64x64 pixels, 16 textures)
- **After**: 6x6 atlas (96x96 pixels, 36 textures)
- **New textures** added at positions 12-15:
  - Position 12: Cobblestone texture
  - Position 13: Brick texture  
  - Position 14: Planks texture
  - Position 15: Iron ore texture

### 3. World Generation Integration

#### Mountains Biome Enhancement
- Added architectural variety to mountain surfaces
- 20% chance for brick blocks (mountainNoise > 0.8)
- 10% chance for cobblestone blocks (mountainNoise > 0.7) 
- Remaining 70% remains stone

#### Forest Biome Enhancement  
- Added rare wooden structures
- 10% chance for wooden planks on forest surface (forestNoise > 0.9)
- Remaining 90% remains grass

#### Underground Ore Generation
- **Iron ore deposits**: Generated at depths below y=30 with 30% probability
- **Cobblestone patches**: Generated at depths y=30-50 with 20% probability  
- Uses 3D Perlin noise for realistic ore distribution

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified
- `include/Chunk.h`: Added new BlockType enum entries
- `src/Chunk.cpp`: Added texture mappings and world generation logic
- `src/Renderer.cpp`: Updated atlas size from 4 to 6
- `assets/textures/textureAtlas01.png`: Replaced with 6x6 version

#### Texture Mappings
All new blocks use simple uniform textures (same texture on all faces):
```cpp
{COBBLESTONE, {12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12}},
{BRICK, {13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13}},
{PLANKS, {14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14}},
{IRON_ORE, {15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15}},
```

## Impact

### Gameplay Impact
- **Mining**: Players can now find iron ore underground for crafting
- **Building**: New building materials (brick, cobblestone, planks) for construction
- **Exploration**: More varied terrain with architectural elements

### Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact
- Larger texture atlas uses more VRAM but modern GPUs handle 96x96 textures easily
- World generation adds small overhead for noise calculations

### Extensibility
- 20 unused texture slots (IDs 16-35) available for future blocks
- Easy to add more block types following the same pattern
- World generation system can be easily extended for new biomes

## Future Enhancements
- Add block breaking/crafting mechanics
- Implement different hardness values for new blocks
- Add more complex texture variations
- Create multi-texture blocks (like logs with different top/side textures)
- Add structure generation using the new building materials
